          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October
            1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He was an Indian aerospace scientist
            and the 11th President of India, serving from 2002 to 2007. He was a
            key figure in India's civilian space program and military missile
            development efforts. He played a pivotal role in India's Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests in 1998, which made India a nuclear power. He was also
            known for his work on the Indian National Satellite System and the
            development of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). He was a
            strong advocate for education and youth empowerment, often referred
            to as the "People's President" for his approachable nature and
            dedication to public service. After his presidency, he continued to
            inspire students and young professionals through his lectures and
            writings. He passed away on 27 July 2015 while delivering a lecture
            at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong.
